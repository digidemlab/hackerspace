<h1>How do you <em>understand</em> programming?</h1>

<p>Modern computers are a big fluffball of complexity. There are so many things to learn about them, it's impossible to understand everything. Programming is no exception. This can be frustrating, because it means you write code that doesn't completely make sense to you. There is always <em>something</em> that can't be explained, and if you try to understand every detail, you'll end up feeling constantly unfinished with your learning.</p>

<p>Calculating 1 + 1 over and over doesn't make you learn more mathematics. In the same way, learning programming is about doing what you <em>can't</em> do. Push your limits. This can create a conflict with what we expect from ourselves -- when you hear "we talked about this", yet you don't even know what to write in the blank page that is supposed to be your code assignment. This likely means the teacher (or you, if you're teaching yourself) should give you an easier assignment. However, in those cases you can't control your teacher, the thing we can do instead is to change our views.</p>

<h2>Changing our views on our learning</h2>

<p>Changing our view of our learning is about awareness. Think of how you learned other subjects that you feel good at.</p>

<p>I'm serious. Take a minute. Think about your favourite subject and how you learned it.</p>

<p>Done? Okay. One thing you might find is that you learned one <em>aspect</em> at a time. When learning to draw, your teacher might've told you to start with big shapes and continually work your way inward, starting with the most important aspects of the object you're trying to draw. Another way to think of it is this: If we see an animal in the woods, how do we know if it is a moose? Let's try our moose-identifying skills by looking at some pictures.</p>

<p>Oh gosh, that's obviously a moose! Look at the horns! How about this one?</p>

<img src="female_moose.jpg" />

<p>Does this feel equally obvious? I personally feel like its nose is very moose-y, and that's how I recognize it, but it's not as clear as the one with horns. How about the next one?</p>

<img src="moose_far_away.jpg" />

<p>Depending on your screen size you might not even see it, but the dark brown color, long legs, and big, adorable ears on a knobbly body in a boreal forest make this a moose for me. If you ask someone who did not grow up in a moose-loving area, they might think it's a deer.</p>

<p>Aside from the sheer fun of moose-gazing, the point I'm trying to make is this: How does a moose-expert identify a moose? They know more aspects of the moose, and can identify it using less and less information. In fact, I'll be bold and say that there are <em>endless</em> aspects to learn about the moose. So when can we truly say that we <em>know</em> what a moose really is?</p>

<p>When have we truly <em>mastered</em> the moose?</p>

<p>In my opinion, the answer is both 1) we never know enough, and 2) we know enough when we know what we need for our current needs. If I feel confident enough in moose identification that I can brag to my friends about seeing one in real life, I know enough about the moose. A moose veterinarian probably thinks otherwise.</p>

<p>Now, back to programming. When you doubt your programming knowledge, what is it that makes you think, "I am not good enough"? Is it that you don't grasp every <em>aspect</em> of what you're learning currently? In that case, you probably want to rethink, because learning every aspect takes forever. If not that, maybe you feel stuck in your assignment, the pressure of the course curriculum looming over you as you fall behind your teacher's expectations? In that case ...</p>

<p>... stop coding, and listen.</p>

<p>Stare at the assignment instructions for a while.</p>

<p>Listen to your thoughts wondering whether your IQ is lower than that of a seagull.</p>

<p>Stare at the blank text file screaming at you to start coding.</p>

<p>Look at the <em>aspects</em> that the teacher expects you to know, and feel your gut telling you these are pointless and that you will never learn them.</p>

<p>Now listen close. This very moment is programming. Code goes together with doubts and expectations. Learning to love these moments is what loving programming is all about. After over 10 years of programming, I recently spent hours just staring at my code, waiting for ideas to come by, and I put myself in that situation willingly. Frustration has become my friend.</p>

<p>Of course, making frustration your friend takes practice. It's okay not to enjoy it, and it's okay to go back to easier programming that you've already learned and stay there. There are also countless techniques that I've learned to handle being stuck. However, the most important aspect to me will always be to stop and listen. Even when your teacher's assignment is your enemy, your thoughts and emotions are there to help, not to sabotage.</p>
